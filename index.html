<a name="yet-another-java-tree-structure" class="anchor" href="#yet-another-java-tree-structure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yet another Java tree structure</h1>

<p>There are a couple of tree data structures in Java, such as <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/tree/DefaultMutableTreeNode.html"><code>DefaultMutableTreeNode</code></a> in JDK Swing, <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/trees/Tree.html"><code>Tree</code></a> in Stanford parser package, and other toy codes. But none of these are sufficient yet small enough for general purpose.</p>

<h3>
<a name="contribution-" class="anchor" href="#contribution-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribution (:))</h3>

<p>This project attempts to provide another general-purpose tree data structure in Java. The difference between this and others are</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Totally free</strong>. You can use it anywhere (except in your homework :P)</li>
<li> <strong>Small but general enough</strong>. I put everything of the data structure in one class file, so it would be easy to copy/paste.</li>
<li> <strong>Not just a toys</strong>. I am aware of dozens of Java tree codes that can only handle binary trees or limited operations. This <code>TreeNode</code> is much more than that. It provides different ways of visiting nodes, such as preorder, postorder, breadthfirst, leaves, path to root, etc. Moreover, iterators are provided too for the sufficiency.</li>
<li> <strong>More utils will be added</strong>. I am willing to add more operations to make this project comprehensive, especially if you send a request through <a href="https://github.com/yfpeng/java-tree"><strong>github</strong></a>.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="treenode" class="anchor" href="#treenode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TreeNode</h3>

<p>A <code>TreeNode</code> may have at most one parent and 0 or more children. It provides operations for examining and modifying a node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that the node is a part of. A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to parents and children. A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a node with no children is a leaf. A tree may consist of many subtrees, each node acting as the root for its own subtree.</p>

<p>A <code>TreeNode</code> provides iterator for efficiently traversing a tree or subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes. A <code>TreeNode</code> may also hold a reference to a user object, the use of which is left to the user. Asking a <code>TreeNode</code> for its string representation with <em>toString()</em> returns the string representation of its user object.</p>

<p>This is not a thread safe class. If you intend to use a <code>TreeNode</code> (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is synchronizing on the root node of a tree. </p>

<p>Most source code is copied from <code>DefaultMutableTreeNode</code> by Rob Davis, and modified for general purposes. </p>

<a name="print-treenode" class="anchor" href="#print-treenode"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Print TreeNode</h3>

<p>This project provides two formats to print out a tree structure. One is a human readable format (<code>TreeString</code>), like</p>

<pre><code>└ a
  ├ b
  ├ c
  │ ├ e
  │ └ f
  └ d
</code></pre>

<p>The other is Penn Treebank format (<code>PtbString</code>), like</p>

<pre><code>(a b (c (e f) d)
</code></pre>

<p>The following code snippet shows how to print a <code>TreeNode</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-java"><pre><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">PtbString</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">treeNode</span><span class="o">));</span>
<span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">TreeString</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">treeNode</span><span class="o">));</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>
<a name="other-utils" class="anchor" href="#other-utils"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other utils</h3>

<p>comming soon...</p>

<p>Some frequently used utils will be provded, such as <em>lowest common ancestor</em>, <em>tregrep</em>, etc.</p>
